# ChatBot for Python(Title)
This contains code on a chatbot project(not finished yet) and it's in Python code.
This is only in functions(for now) and it's NOT to be used by mainstream developers(or big creators).

# Introduction(Sub-Heading or Strap-Line)
WARNING: This is NOT(and I mean NOT) a full scale AI project, it is only a part-time activity.
This is an under-development(UD or WIP) AI(Python only and maybe HTML and CSS and JS, depends).
Don't expect great results but it is going to be good(if you ask me).

# Usage(Sub-Heading or Strap-Line)
As said in the Title, it is not to be used by mainstream developers(or big creators) as it is not a big(or full scaled) project.
It is to be used as a snippet of free code to aid projects or as a start to projects.
CommandBeat(Me) is not to be refrenced in the usage, showcase or even tutorial of this code snippet.

# Installation
1. Create a folder in D: called "Python Code".
2. Create a folder in "Python Code" called "ChatBot"
3. Create a .py file called "main.py"
4. (WIP)
